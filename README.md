E-ARK CS PREMIS
=================

## E-ARK Common Specification for Preservation Metadata

This is the common specification for preservation metadata based upon the standard Preservation Metadata Implementation Strategies (PREMIS) found at https://www.loc.gov/standards/premis/. The CS specification has extended and contains the information previously found in CSIP, SIP, AIP and DIP and will be extended with an XML-schema with validation rules following the CS. The specification itself is only a starting point giving the minimum needed since preservation planning and the implementation of PREMIS will differ in all available solutions. 

A note: Following a decision in the DILCIS Board the specification has been renamed as a Common Specification. [DILCIS Board notes 1](https://github.com/DILCISBoard/GroupDocumentation/blob/master/MeetingNotes/2023/20230815%20DILCIS%20Board.md) and [DILCIS Board notes 2](https://github.com/DILCISBoard/GroupDocumentation/blob/master/MeetingNotes/2023/20230913%20DILCIS%20Board.md)
