E-ARK CITS PREMIS
=================

## E-ARK Content Information Type Specification for Preservation Metadata

This is the content information type specification for preservation metadata based upon the standard Preservation Metadata Implementation Strategies (PREMIS) found at https://www.loc.gov/standards/premis/. The CITS specification has extended and contains the information previously found in CSIP, SIP, AIP and DIP and will be extended with an XML-schema with validation rules following the CITS. The specification itself is only a starting point giving the minimum needed since preservation planning and the implementation of PREMIS will differ in all available solutions.
